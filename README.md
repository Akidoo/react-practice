# App & JSX
Curly braces indicate a *javascript expression*. A lack of curly braces renders text as is, as it is plain HTML.

Objects cannot be rendered as javascript expression, it will return an error

![title](Images/Error-page.png)
###### For Vite, you will simply get a blank page, with nothing rendered.

A boolean will not return an error, however it will not render.

To comment, enclose */ */ with curly braces.

Functions are typically started with the word "handle" as convention, and can also be rendered as javascript expressions.
